# foo_uie_webview

[foo_uie_webview](https://github.com/stuerp/foo_uie_webview/releases) is a [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) component that exposes the [Microsoft WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) control as UI panel. The component started as foo_vis_text.

It takes an HTML file that receives playback notifications from foobar2000. The panel can react to those notifications and adjust its output using JavaScript code.
